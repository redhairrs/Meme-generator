## Description

In this project I created an interactive web app in React using functional programming. When the App first loads, it gets 100 of the most popular memes from an external API. Then it allows the user to choose a randomly displayed image and add text to it via two input fields.

## User stories

**As a user, I would like to see a randomly chosen meme image, when I click a button.**

**As a user, I would like to enter the text, that immediately shows up at the top and at the bottom of the image.**
